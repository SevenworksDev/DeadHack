# Tools directory for DeadHack
# Add your tool
Create a zip file that contains a folder with a icon.png, tool_name_here.exe and a info.json (template below) file inside it named after your project.
```json
{
  "author": "Me",
  "description": "My own tool!",
  "exec": "Tool.exe"
}
```
Edit the apps.json file in the repo to contain your tools information and a valid direct link to your zip file (Discord CDN, GitHub Raw, Catbox.moe and FroCDN are examples) then submit a PR
